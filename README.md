# RestModel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heroku/rest-model.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heroku/rest-model)

RestModel is a library for interacting with a REST API in Ember. Its goal is to
provide a library with predictable behavior and which can be easily extended to
meet custom needs.

**This fork of RESTModel is no longer maintained and will not receive future updates. Use [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) instead.**

## Install

```bash
bower install heroku/rest-model --save
```

## Use

### Basic Use

Using RestModel is as simple as extending it to create a custom model class, and
providing a URL for that model:

```javascript
var App = RestModel.extend().reopenClass({
  url: '/apps'
});
```

`App` can now be used to fetch resources from the `/apps` endpoint:

```javascript
// Fetch all apps (GET /apps):
App.all().then(function(apps) {
  apps[0].constructor === App;
});

// Fetch a single app (GET /apps/:id):
App.find(1).then(function(app) {
  app.constructor === App;
});
```

`App`s can also be created, fetched, updated, and destroyed:

```javascript
var existingApp = App.create({ id: params.id });
existingApp.fetch().then(function(existingApp) {
  existingApp.get('name') === 'existing-app-name';
});

var newApp = App.create({ name: 'new-app-name' });
newApp.save().then(function(newApp) {
  newApp.get('id') === 2;
  return newApp.delete();
}).then(function() {
  // newApp has been deleted
});
```

### Working with Nested Resources

Working with nested resources is as simple as providing a nested URL with
placeholder segments, and providing parent objects and keys for each record:

```javascript
var Post = RestModel.extend().reopenClass({
  url: '/posts'
});

var Comment = RestModel.extend().reopenClass({
  url: '/posts/:post/comments'
});

var post = Post.create({ id: 1 });

Comment.all(post).then(function(comments) { // GET /posts/1/comments
  comments[0].constructor === Comment;
});

Comment.find(post, 2).then(function(comment) { // GET /posts/1/comments/2
  comment.constructor === Comment;
});

var comment = Comment.create({ parents: [post], body: 'hello' });
comment.save().then(function(comment) { // POST /posts/1/comments
  comment.constructor === Comment;
});
```

There is no concept of belongs-to/has-many in RestModel. All models are managed
individually, and `parents` can be used on any record&mdash;their primary keys
will be interpolated as is appropriate into the URL.

### Custom Namespaces

If resources are behind a custom namespace, one can be provided via the
`namespace` property on the class:

```javascript
var Model = RestModel.extend().reopenClass({
  namespace: 'api'
});

var App = Model.extend().reopenClass({
  url: '/apps'
});

App.all(); // GET `/api/apps`
```

### Custom Primary Keys

Your API may allow you to find resources by, for example, both `id` and `name`.
RestModel supports this via the `primaryKeys` array property on the class, which
defaults to `['id']`. Any time RestModel needs a primary key to fetch or save a
record, it will iterate over these keys in order until it finds one for which
the model has a value.

```javascript
var App = RestModel.extend().reopenClass({
  url: '/apps',
  primaryKeys: ['id', 'name']
});
```

Now, say a user visits `/apps/my-app` in your Ember app. Your route will want
to fetch the `App` model for them, and RestModel can fetch it by `name`, since
that value is provided in `primaryKeys`:

```javascript
var AppsRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function(params) {
    return App.create({ name: params.name }).fetch();
  }
});
```

All subsequent API requests for that `App` instance will be made using `id`,
assuming your API returns this property.

### Determining If a Record Has Changed

RestModel provides an `isDirty` property on each instance that returns `true` if
attributes on the record have been changed from their original values. When a
record is successfully `save()`d, the new values are considered the "original
values".

In order to determine `isDirty`, RestModel requires that you provide an array
called `attrs` that contains the attributes to dirty check against:

```javascript
var App = RestModel.extend({
  attrs: ['name']
}).reopenClass({
  url: '/apps'
});

var app = App.create({ name: 'foo' });
app.get('isDirty'); // false
app.set('name', 'bar');
app.get('isDirty'); // true
```

### Reverting a Changed Record

Assuming that a record has an `attrs` array defined, it can be reverted to its
original values if it has changed. Remember that changing a record and then
saving it will cause the record to consider its new properties its "original
properties", and it won't revert.

```javascript
var app = App.create({ name: 'foo' });
app.get('name'); // 'foo'
app.set('name', 'bar');
app.get('name'); // 'bar'
app.revert();
app.get('name'); // 'foo'
```

### Serializing a Record for Saving/Updating

When a record is saved or updated, `#serialize` is called on it, which is a
method that returns a JSON string. By default, this method will either serialize
any properties in a `serializedProperties` property array on the record, or it
will simply call `JSON.stringify(this)` if no such property exists.

This method can be overridden easily, as long as it returns a JSON string.

### Deserializing Records

When a record is returned from the API, `::deserialize` is called on its class,
with the API response object as the argument. By default, this method simply
calls `return this.create(object)`, returning an instance of the class.

When an array is returned, `::deserializeArray` is called on its class, with the
API response array as the argument. By default, this simply returns a map of
calling `::deserialize` with each member of the array.

These methods can be overridden for custom API response deserialization.

### Setting Custom Request Headers

Each class can choose to implement a `getBeforeSend` function. This function
should return a function whose single argument is a jQuery XMLHttpRequest
object (`jqXHR`). Custom request headers can be added and removed here, as it
will be called on every AJAX request for this class.

The `getBeforeSend` method itself receives an object of options, including
things like the request method (e.g. `'GET'`) to be used by the impending AJAX
request.

```javascript
var App = RestModel.extend().reopenClass({
  url: '/apps',

  getBeforeSend: function(options) {
    return function(jqXHR) {
      jqXHR.setRequestHeader('foo', 'bar');
    }
  }
})
```

## Building

Before a release, RestModel should be built with a non-uglified and an uglified
version into its `dist` directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm test
```

## Thanks, Heroku

While I created and maintain this project, it was done while I was an employee
of [Heroku][heroku] on the Human Interfaces Team, and they were kind enough to
allow me to open source the work. Heroku is awesome.
